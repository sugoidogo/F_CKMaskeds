# F_CKMaskeds
This is a mod that removes masked enemies from Lethal Company.
This mod is based entirely off of [Odie's F_CKSpiders mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Odie/F_CKSpiders/),
using the same method to delete enemies as soon as they spawn.
This mod does not prevent the mask from spawning as loot.
